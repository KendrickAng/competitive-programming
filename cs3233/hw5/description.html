<h1>Fleet Provisions Management</h1>

<p>Time Limit: 1s.<br>
</p>

<h2>Problem Description</h2>

<p>The hunters of the world are preparing to capture the fabled Elder Dragon, Zorah Magdaros!</p>
<p>
    As the head logistics manager of the famed Fourth Logistics Fleet, you are put in charge of
    ensuring there are enough potions to keep the hunters healthy! 
    A capable manager as always, you quickly sourced the potions.
</p>
<p>
    However, potions can't be kept in storage forever - they have an <i>initial integrity</i> 
    which decreases at a constant <i>integrity decay rate</i> every day. 
    Potions must have a positive, non-zero integrity to still be considered <i>usable</i>.
    It's up to you to ensure you still have enough usable potions before the hunt begins!
</p>
<p>
    Given <i>N</i>, the number of potions, <i>II</i> the initial integrity and <i>ID</i>, the integrity decay of each potion,
    find the maximum number of days you can wait such that there still remains at least <i>I</i> potion items
    that are usable.
</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>
    The first line of input contains <b>T</b>, the number of test cases.<br>
    This is followed by <b>T</b> test cases.<br>
    Each test case is preceded by a blank line, followed by:
    <ul>
        <li>Two integers: <b>N</b> and <b>I</b>.</li>
        <li>A line of <b>N</b> integers, each representing the initial integrity <b>II</b> of the <i>i</i>th potion item.</li>
        <li>A line of <b>N</b> integers, each representing the integrity decay <b>ID</b> of the <i>i</i>th potion item.</li>
    </ul>
    The input will be terminated with an EOF.
</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>
    For each test case, output a line containing a single integer: the maximum number of days such that there remains at least <i>I</i> usable potion items.
</p>

<div>
    <b>Explanation of the first test case</b>
    <ul>
        <li>There are two potions.</li>
        <li>The first has integrity 3 and decays by 1 integrity per day. </li>
        <li>The second has integrity 4 and decays by 2 integrity per day.</li>
        <li>We need at least two potions to remain usable. </li>
        <li>After 1 day, both the first and second potions have 2 integrity left. </li>
        <li>After 2 days, the first potion has integrity 1 but the second potion has 0 integrity, and becomes unusable - only 1 potion is left usable.</li>
        <li>Hence the maximum number of days we can wait is 1.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <b>Explanation of the second test case</b>
    <ul>
        <li>There are three potions.</li>
        <li>We need at least one potion to remain usable.</li>
        <li>The maximum number of days we can wait is 4, where the potion with 5 initial integrity will still have 1 integrity left, and remains usable.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
